<a name="int"></a><h2>Introduction<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>This document assumes that the reader has some knowledge
of resources, what they are and how they work.
<p>This document is intended for use with the GoRC resource
compiler. There are some slight differences in the permitted syntax between
the Microsoft Resource compiler and GoRC. In general GoRC will accept all
RC source files that the Microsoft Resource compiler will accept but is 
slightly more flexible in its syntax.
<p>RC source files (those with an ".rc" extension) should be text without 
formatting codes, other than carriage return, linefeed or tabs, such as 
produced by most simple text editors.
More sophisticated word processors can also produce such files
if they are instructed to produce TXT files, ASCII or ANSI files.
<p>The resource script and include files can be in Unicode format.  If so,
GoRC expects a Byte Order Mark (BOM).  GoRC can read the UTF-8 Unicode format
with BOM, or the UTF-16LE Unicode format with BOM.
<p>GoRC can make
two types of <i>binary resource files</i> from a resource script. It can
make an OBJ file in COFF format, which is suitable for linking with other
OBJ files to produce the final EXE or DLL. It can also produce a RES file,
which is an intermediate file in binary format. GoRC can also convert a
RES file to an OBJ file.
<p>The OBJ file made by GoRC can either be in Win32 format (the default)
or Win64 format if you specify the /machine AMD64 or /machine X64 switch 
in the command line.
<p>Here are the syntax rules which are used in this reference:-
<ul>
<li>Normal text shows words as they actually appear in your source code.</li>
<li><i>Italic text describes only the type of entry in your
source code- look for the description to see what can be put there.</i></li>
<li>[Text in square brackets means that the material is optional].</li>
</ul>
<a name="start"></a><h2>Starting the Resource Compiler<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The command line syntax is:-<br>
<pre>GoRC [<i>command line switches</i>] <i>filename</i>[.<i>ext</i>]</pre>
<p>Where,<br>
<pre><i>command line switches</i>		can be one or more of the following:-
							/h or /?			help
							/d				define a word
							/o				create OBJ file
							/r				create RES file
							/fo				specify output file
							/machine AMD64	or
							/machine X64		object output file will be in 64-bit format
							/ne				no error messages
							/ni				no information messages
							/nw				no warning messages
							/nu				no warning message for a user-defined resource type
							/no				no output messages at all

<i>filename</i>					is the name of the resource script

<i>ext</i>						is the extension of the filename of the resource script</pre>
<p><b>Input and Output files</b>
<br>The default action of GoRC is <b>RC > RES and OBJ.</b>
<br>If no extension is given in the command line and GoRC
cannot find <i>filename</i>.RC then it looks for <i>filename</i>.RES. If
found, this results in the action<b> RES > OBJ.</b>
<p>The default action can be overridden to achieve
<b>RC > RES</b> in the following ways:-
<ul>
<li>Specifying a RES output file using the /r switch</li>
<li>Using the /fo switch and giving a filename with the RES extension</li>
</ul>
<p>The default action can be overridden to achieve
<b>RC > OBJ</b> in the following ways:-
<ul>
<li>Specifying an OBJ output file using the /o switch</li>
<li>Using the /fo switch and giving a filename with the OBJ extension</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ensure the action is
<b>RES > OBJ</b> by giving the input file with the extension RES.
<p>By default, the output filenames will be the same as those
of the input file, but you can use the /fo switch to change this. This
is used as follows:-
<ul>
<li>use /fo <i>filename</i> to make the output files <i>filename</i>.OBJ
and <i>filename</i>.RES</li>
<li>use /fo <i>filename</i>.OBJ to make the output file <i>filename</i>.OBJ;
the RES output file will have the same name as the input file</li>
<li>use /fo <i>filename</i>.RES to make the output file <i>filename</i>.RES;
the OBJ output file will have the same name as the input file</li>
<li>use /fo <i>filename1</i>.RES, <i>filename2</i>.OBJ to make output files
matching the specified filenames; here two filenames are separated by a comma</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the output files will be placed in the same directory
as the input file. You can specify a full path for the output files when
using the /fo switch. You can enclose the filenames in quotes to permit
the use of filenames with spaces and other unusual characters.
<p>GoRC can work with Unicode input and output filenames, but the extensions
used must be as set out above.
<p><b>Errors and Warnings</b>
<br>Errors will cause the Resource Compiler to stop and no
output files will be made. The console then shows the nature of the error
and where it occurred. (unless the command line switch /ne has been specified).
The Resource Compiler will also return with a code of 1, which will be
likely to halt the build process if you are using a make file.
<p>Warnings do not stop the Resource Compiler. A warning
will be given (unless the command line switch /nw has been specified) if:-
<ul>
<li>An expression could not be evaluated when expecting an <i>identifier</i>.
In this instance the Resource Compiler treats the expression as being an
ID with a name. However this may not be your intention, if, for example
you thought you had provided a #define directive for the expression.</li>
<li>An expression could not be evaluated when expecting a resource
<i>type</i>. In this instance the Resource Compiler treats the expression
as defining a resource, that is, a <i>user-defined resource</i>. Again
this may not be your intention, so a warning is given (unless the command line switch /nu has been specified).</li>
<li>No resources are found in the resource file. In this case
no output file is made.</li>
</ul>
<p>A warning will also be given if an expression has been defined
more than once in the command line, resource script or in a non ".h" include
file. This is because it would be unusual to define an expression more
than once and it may be that this is a programming error. It is perfectly
permissible to cancel a previous definition using #undef so that the expression
can be redefined. In that case no warning is given. Also, because the Resource
Compiler does not always need to look into ".h" files to evaluate an expression,
and because it is presumed that such ".h" files ought to be free of such
errors, no check of previous definitions in header files is carried out.
<a name="dir"></a><h2>Directives<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>Directives are words in the resource script which give
instructions to the Resource Compiler.
<p>There are 3 types of directives:-
<ul>
<li>Defining directives</li>
<li>Include directive</li>
<li>Conditional directives</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Defining Directives</h3>
<h4>Evaluating types</h4>
<p>These are #define macros which evaluate to a number or to a quoted string:-<br>
<pre>#define <i>name value</i></pre>
<p>From this point when <i>name</i> is encountered in the
resource script it is replaced by <i>value</i>.
<pre><b><u>Examples</u></b>
#define IDC_BUTTON 0x20
#define DLGCONTROL 0x20 | 0x40
#define DLGTEXT "Hello world"
#define OTHER DLGCONTROL + IDC_BUTTON
#define WINNT
<i>(this sets the name WINNT to a value of 1, that is, TRUE)</i></pre>
<p>The RC compiler <b>automatically defines RC_INVOKED</b>, so that you can use
the conditional directives to skip over unwanted resource script text.
<pre><b><u>Example</u></b>
#ifndef RC_INVOKED
<i>skipped text</i>
#endif</pre>
<p>You can define a <i>name</i> from the command line:-
<pre><b><u>Examples</u></b>
GoRC /d WINVER=400h mainres
<i>This compiles the resource script mainres, on the basis that WINVER is equal to hex 400 throughout.</i>

GoRC /d WINNT mainres
<i>This compiles the resource script mainres, on the basis that WINNT has a value of 1 (that is, TRUE).</i>

GoRC /d WINNT=55h /d good=0x44 mainres
<i>Example of more than one definition.</i>

GoRC /d WINNT=330, good=0x44 mainres
<i>Example of more than one definition using comma.</i></pre>
<p>To remove the value for a definition and have <i>name</i> undefined, use #undef:
<pre>#undef <i>name</i></pre>
<p>From this point in the resource script any earlier value for the
name given by a #define is no longer used.
<pre><b><u>Examples</u></b>
#undef IDC_BUTTON
#undef DLGCONTROL</pre>
<h4>Non evaluating types</h4>
<p>These are #define macros which do not evaluate to a single result:-
<pre>#define <i>name value1 value2 value3</i></pre>
<p>From this point when <i>name</i> is encountered in the
resource script it is replaced by <i>value1 value2 value3</i>.
<pre><b><u>Example</u></b>
#define GRASSHOPPER Deep Influences On Us
#define FILENAME README
#define EXTENSION TXT
FILENAME.EXTENSION <i>(becomes README.TXT)</i></pre>
<h4>Macros with arguments</h4>
<p>These are #define macros which use the arguments supplied
when the macro is used.
<p>Syntax for the macro in which the arguments are declared:-
<pre>#define &nbsp;<i>name(arg1,arg2,arg3,...) &nbsp;&nbsp;use of arguments</i></pre>
<p>Syntax to supply the arguments:-
<pre><i>name(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)</i>

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
#define NIM($a,$b) $a+$b
NIM(23,45)
<i>(result is 68)</i>

#define NIMROD($a,$b) #$a
NIMROD (HANG,OVER)
<i>(result is "HANG")</i></pre>
<p>Note that the number of arguments which are <i>supplied</i>
must exactly match the number of arguments <i>declared</i>, but they need
not all be <i>used</i>. When an argument is <i>declared</i> there must
be no space between the macro name and the arguments, but there can be
spaces when the argument is <i>supplied</i> or <i>used.</i>
<h3>The Include Directive</h3>
<p>The #include directive will cause the Resource Compiler to load and look
at the specified file:-
<pre>#include <i>path\filename</i></pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>path\filename</i>	can be either:-
				a quoted string</li>
				a non-quoted string</li>
				a string in less-than and greater-than characters</pre>
<p>The Resource Compiler will look for the file using the path
specified. If no path is specified it will look in the current directory.
If the file is not found it will look for it in the path given by the INCLUDE
environment string. You can set the INCLUDE environment string using the
SET command in the MSDOS window, or by calling the SetEnvironmentVariable
API.  You can also use <i>control panel, system, advanced, environment</i> 
if your operating system will permit this, followed by a reboot.  
<i>Note: there may be a different 
environment string for each folder or sub-folder.  Ensure the environment 
string you wish to use is in the current directory.</i>
<p>To the Resource Compiler there are two types of #include
files:-
<ul>
<li>There are "header" files, with the file extension ".h".
These files are not treated as part of the resource script, but are regarded
only as containing defining directives. This enables the Resource Compiler
to work more quickly because it will not bother to search an ".h" file
unless it has an expression which it is trying to evaluate. Any ordinary
resource script statements in an ".h" file will be ignored by the Resource
Compiler.<br>
<br>Note that the Resource Compiler is itself aware of most
if not all of the usual styles and expressions used in a resource script.
For this reason it will not normally be necessary to include any header
files. However you will need to define your own expressions and identifiers
if you wish to use those.<br><br></li>
<li>The second type of #include files are non ".h" files.
These are treated as part of the resource script itself by the Resource
Compiler. When an #include directive if found for a non ".h" file, the
Resource Compiler will divert its attention to the #include file and when
it has finished looking at that file it will return to the original script
where it left off.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can nest #include files but it is probably good practice
to avoid this as far as possible.
<h4>Definition Priority</h4>
<p>A #define directive in an ".h" include file is regarded
as of lower priority than a #define directive in the command line, resource
script or in a non ".h" include file. Therefore if there is any conflict
between the #defines, the #define in the ".h" include file will be ignored.
<h3>The Conditional Directives</h3>
<p>With these directives you can select at compile-time that
part of the resource script or of the defining directives which you want
to be compiled. This may be useful if, for example, you want to make different
versions of your program from the same resource script.
<p>The syntax of the basic structure of a conditional directive
in its simplest form is as follows:-
<pre>#if <i>condition</i>
	text A
#endif</pre>
<p>Here if the <i>condition</i> is TRUE text A will be compiled.
If, however, the <i>condition</i> is FALSE, the compiler will jump over
text A and will continue compiling from the #endif.
<p>You can add something to do if the condition is FALSE
as follows:-
<pre>#if <i>condition</i>
	text A
#else
	text B
#endif</pre>
<p>Here if the <i>condition</i> is TRUE, text A will be compiled,
but text B will not be compiled. If, however, the <i>condition</i> is FALSE,
text A will be jumped over but text B will be compiled.
<p>The #endif indicates the end of the conditional frame,
so that all text after that will be compiled.
<p>The #else statement must always be next before the #endif.
<p>You can add a further condition to the frame:-
<pre>#if <i>condition1</i>
	text A
#elif <i>condition2</i>
	text B
#endif</pre>
<p>Here if <i>condition1</i> is TRUE, text A will be compiled,
but text B will be jumped over and compilation will continue from the #endif.
If, however, <i>condition1</i> is FALSE, text A will be jumped over to
the #elif when condition2 will be tested. If then <i>condition2</i> is
TRUE, text B will be compiled. "#elif" is the same as "#elseif".
<p>Adding the #else to the above conditional frame produces:-
<pre>#if <i>condition1</i>
	text A
#elif <i>condition2</i>
	text B
#else
	text C
#endif</pre>
<p>Here if <i>condition1</i> is TRUE, text A will be compiled,
but text B and text C will be jumped over and compilation will continue
from the #endif. If, however, <i>condition1</i> is FALSE, text A will be
jumped over to the #elif when condition2 will be tested. If then <i>condition2</i>
is TRUE, text B will be compiled, and text C will be ignored; if, however
<i>condition2</i> is FALSE text B will be jumped over to the #else and
text C will be compiled.
<p>You can have as many #elifs as you like in each conditional
frame, but there can only be one #else per frame, and each #if must have
a corresponding #endif. Some programmers nest the conditional frames, but
this can become very confusing and may not be good programming practice.
If this is done it is recommended that you label each #endif with a comment
so that you can see to which #if it refers.
<h3>Types of #if statements</h3>
<pre>#ifdef <i>expression</i>		where <i>expression</i> is a word which may be defined in the resource script
					or in a header file. This statement returns TRUE if the expression is defined
					and FALSE if it is not defined. The <i>expression</i> must be a word and not a
					number nor a quoted string.
		
#ifndef <i>expression</i>		as above but this statement returns FALSE if the expression is defined and
					TRUE if it is not defined.

#if &nbsp;0					this statement always returns FALSE and so it can be used to jump over
					text which ought to be ignored.

#if <i>expression1 &nbsp;relational-operator&nbsp; expression2</i>

					where,

					<i>expression1</i> must be a word which is defined elsewhere in the file,
					in an include file or on the command line. It cannot be a number.

					<i>relational operator</i> can be one of the following:-
						&gt;=	greater than or equals
						&lt;=	less than or equals
						==	equals
						=	equals
						!=	not equal
						&gt;	greater than
						&lt;	less than

					<i>expression2</i> can be a number or a word which is defined elsewhere in
					the file, in an include file or on the command line, which evaluates to a
					number. For example, #if WINVER>=400h will return TRUE if WINVER
					is defined as 400h or more.

#if ! <i>expression</i>		this reverses the result of the condition, so #if is not the same as #if !.
					For example, #if!0 would return TRUE.</pre>
<a name="other"></a><h2>Other Symbols<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>These are some other symbols which may be used in the
resource script or a header file and which have a special meaning to the
Resource Compiler.
<pre>;		single line comment - everything after this to the end of the line is ignored

//		single line comment - everything after this to the end of the line is ignored

;;  ...		block comment - can span several lines and everything between the leading
     ...  ;;	and trailing marks is ignored

/*  ...		block comment - can span several lines and everything between the leading
     ...  */	and trailing marks is ignored

\		line continuation - at the end of a line or just before a comment, allows processing to
		continue with the material on the next line (cannot be used in quoted strings or filenames)

{		same as BEGIN

}		same as END

-<i>number</i>	means the number is negative (eg. -22h if a dword becomes 0FFFFFFDEh)

~<i>number</i>	means the number is inverted (eg. ~22h if a dword becomes 0FFFFFFDDh)

+		plus for addition (eg. 22h + 3h produces 25h)

-		minus for subtraction (eg. 22h - 3h produces 1Fh)

| or &brvbar;		bitwise OR (eg. 22h | 3h produces 23h)

&amp;		bitwise AND (eg. 22h &amp; 3h produces 2h)

!<i>value</i>	in arithmetic, this causes the value to be inverted and
		then ANDed with the existing, and is the same as minus <i>value</i>

NOT <i>value</i>	same as above

#		in a #define macro, this causes quotes to be added to what follows
		eg. #HELLO becomes "HELLO"
		eg. #(MAJOR.MINOR) becomes "MAJOR.MINOR"

##		in a #define macro, this joins two elements, removing all spaces in between
		eg. PATCH ## WORK becomes PATCHWORK

(...)		in a #define macro, the material within the parentheses is evaluated first</pre>
<a name="num"></a><h2>Numbers<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The Resource Compiler recognises the following types of numbers, for example:-
<pre>6666666h	a hex number
3434343H	a hex number
9999999D	a decimal number
22553388d	a decimal number
34567789	a decimal number
0x456789		a hex number
456L		specifies the number is to be recorded as a dword
			where otherwise it would be a word</pre>
<a name="arith"></a><h2>Arithmetic<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The resource compiler can perform limited arithmetic on
the following:-
<ul>
<li>identifiers, styles, flags and dialog and control positions and dimensions</li>
<li>defining directives</li>
<li>expressions in conditional directives</li>
</ul>
<pre><b><u>Examples of arithmetic</u></b>
66h+2h CURSOR first.cur
#define BELLS 200h | 22h + 1h
BELLS+1000h ICON icon1.ico
BELLS-1h ICON icon1.ico
STYLE WS_TABSTOP | WS_GROUP | WS_DISABLED
DIALOG 0x34+2,0x20,0x300-0x60,400-200</pre>
<p>The Resource Compiler cannot resolve more complex formulae involving for example
logical operators, decimal points, multiplication or division.
<a name="string"></a><h2>Strings and String Manipulation<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>Quoted strings in the stringtable resource and in all
text for dialogs and menus must be kept in the binary resource files and
in the EXE in Unicode.  If the resource script is an ANSI text file, however,
the strings will be in ANSI characters. In that case the Resource Compiler 
converts them to Unicode using the API MultiByteToWideChar. This API uses
the current codepage for this conversion, so you need to ensure that at
compile time your machine is set to use the same codepage as was used when
the source script was made.
<p>If the resource script is a Unicode file, then codepages are not used; 
the strings are used as they appear in the resource script.
<p>The strings are put in the RES file (or OBJ file) in Unicode whether or 
not you use the "C" style Unicode indicator L"<i>string</i>". The Resource 
Compiler regards the L"<i>string</i>" indicator as implicit for these types 
of strings.
So there is no need to use that indicator in your resource script (unless
you want to insert special Unicode characters - see below).
<p>There is no implicit L"<i>string</i>" indicator for quoted
strings in the raw data resources (eg. RCDATA). 
Therefore in an ANSI file such strings are not converted
to Unicode unless L"<i>string</i>" is specified.
<p>All quoted strings may contain <i>escape</i> sequences
which are dealt with in a special way by the Resource Compiler:-
<pre>&amp;		in menu title strings this causes the system at run-time to create an
		accelerator for the menu item using the character following the ampersand.
		If you need an ampersand include it twice eg. &amp;&amp;

" "" "		double-up the quotation marks to retain them. For example
		"""Hello there""" will be kept as "Hello there" and
		"He said ""Hello there"" quickly" will be kept as He said "Hello there" quickly

""		an empty string (useful for example in static controls
		where the text is to be inserted during run-time later)

\t		tab (converted to the 9h TAB character)

\a		alert (converted to the 8h BELL character)
		in menus this is used to align all the following text to the right

\n		new line (converted to the 0Ah LINEFEED character)

\r		return (converted to the 0Dh CARRIAGE RETURN character)

\\		converted to one backslash only

\<i>number</i>	see below

\<i>other</i>	the backslash is regarded as an ordinary backslash</pre>
<h3>\<i>number</i> to produce a special character</h3>
<p>In all quoted strings which are converted by the Resource
Compiler you can have:-
<pre>\<i>number</i></pre>
<p>This then will cause the character represented by <i>number</i>
to be inserted in the text.
For example, "Copyright \251 2005" inserts a &copy; symbol in the text.
Strange! The &copy; symbol, as everybody knows, is ANSI
value 169, or A9 in hex.
<p>However, the Resource Compiler uses <i>octal </i>numbers
in this feature rather than decimal, ie. all digits are to base 8. Why?
This is simply to provide compatibility with existing resource scripts.
<p>Sometimes \<i>number</i> can look rather odd. For example
"The entrance fee was \4423", is converted to "The entrance fee was $23".
Here the Resource Compiler does not try to find character 442 octal or
4423 octal because it knows that this value is too high. This works fine
for characters above 38 octal, but for characters with values less than
this, for example 12 octal which is the value 0Ah (linefeed) there could
be confusion, for example "We found on average about\1223 flies in each
of the soups". This should be written "We found on average about\01223
flies in each of the soups". This is because the Resource Compiler will
only look at 3 octal digits and no more, so it stops after the \012 (linefeed),
and the value 23 is kept in the text properly. Of course you could use
\n instead to ensure there is no chance of confusion and this would be
better.
<h3>\<i>number</i> in hex rather than in octal</h3>
<p>You can also use hex values when entering \<i>number</i>,
by including x after the backslash. For example the hex version "Copyright
\xA9 2005" is the same as "Copyright \251 2005" which is the octal version.
Again the Resource Compiler will not look beyond the second hex digit for
the value, so ensure that where small values are used you insert the zero
if there is any danger of confusion. For example in "The capacitor had
a value of 3\xb5farads" the Resource Compiler does not take the hex number
b5f, but looks only at b5 hex. However, in the string "It returned to Earth\x0aafter
44 years with 5 more people on board", the zero is required to avoid using
the hex number aa as the special character.
<h3>\<i>number</i> in Unicode strings</h3>
<p>The Resource Compiler looks at up to four hex digits in \<i>number</i>
if the string is expressly declared to be a Unicode string.
You can do this by using the "C"-style indicator L"<i>string</i>" for the
string. So, for example to create a string for a dialog button which displays
a Shekel you would use the following string:-
<pre>L"\x20AA"</pre>
<p>This creates the Unicode special character 20AAh (the Shekel sign).
<p>You would not need to do this if you used Unicode format files, since 
you could display the Shekel normally and it would be coded properly by
the Resource Compiler.

<p>The character set used when the string is written to the
screen by the menu, dialog or other method, depends on which character
set is in use in the computer running the EXE. For computers used in English
this is usually the Windows Character Set. A table of octal values may
be difficult to find so one is provided as follows for your use, along
with another table afterwards with the hex values.

<h2>Resource Statements</h2>
<p>Resource statements are the instructions to the Resource
Compiler which contain the information from which the output file is actually
made. They fall into four main categories:-
<ul>
<li>Raw data resource types taking data from (a) a file (b) the resource script</li>
<li>The stringtable resource</li>
<li>The information resource types</li>
<li>Resources for the user-interface</li>
</ul>
<a name="raw"></a><h3>Raw data resource types (a) taking data from a file<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h3>
<p>With these resources the Resource Compiler merely takes
raw data from an input file and adds it to the output file (sometimes with
some extra processing). Hence the data from these files makes its way to
the EXE, when the file is linked, for use during run-time. This is a convenient
way to keep the data from such files in the EXE. An alternative would be
to ship the individual files with the product for loading at run-time,
but this runs the risk that those files may get lost.
<p>The data (as raw data) can be used at run-time by calling
the FindResource and LoadResource APIs, but there are some specific APIs
which also provide manipulation of the data. The various raw data resource
types which work using files, their resource type numbers, and the specific
API (if any) to load them during run-time are:-
<pre>CURSOR			1	LoadCursor or LoadImage
BITMAP			2	LoadBitmap or LoadImage
ICON			3	LoadIcon or LoadImage
FONT			8	<i>no longer in use</i>
RCDATA			10
MESSAGETABLE	11	FormatMessage
PLUGPLAY		19
VXD				20
ANICURSOR		21
ANIICON			22
HTML			23
MANIFEST		24
<i>User-defined resource</i></pre>
<p>The <i>User defined resource</i> is a resource holding raw
data only, which is of the <i>type </i>defined by the user. It can be defined
by name, for example, MyRes, or by number, which can be any 16-bit number
above 0FFh. The numbers 1 to 0FFh are reserved for the system defined resources.
<p>The general syntax for these resource types in the resource
script (using CURSOR as an example) is:-
<pre><i>nameID </i>CURSOR <i>filename</i></pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>nameID</i>	can be either:-
			a 16-bit number of value 1 to 7FFFh
			an expression which evaluates to that number
			a name (except for FONT, a FONT resource cannot be identified by name)</pre>
<pre><i>filename</i>	can be either:-
			a quoted string
			a non-quoted string
			a string in less-than and greater-than characters

			Unless the file is in the current directory, the full path should be given.</pre>
<pre><b><u>Examples</u></b>
2 CURSOR happy.cur
0x6666 BITMAP c:\bitmaps\happy.bmp
MyIcon ICON "happy.ico"
#define ID_MINE 22
ID_MINE ICON &lt;happier.ico>
44h RCDATA happy.txt
ID_MINE RCDATA happier.txt
1 MANIFEST "YourApp.manifest"
788h MYRES happier.txt			<i>;(a user-defined resource)</i>
MY_CAT WAVE sounds/cat.wav	<i>;(a user-defined resource)</i>
788h 100h happier.txt			<i>;(a user-defined resource)</i></pre>
<h3>Raw data resource types (b) taking data from resource script</h3>
<p>These resources allow you to insert raw data into the
EXE via the binary resource file. The Resource Compiler makes no alteration
to the raw data. Unless use is being made of the ability of the system
to distinguish between resources of different languages, assembler programmers
would probably not find much use for this as it is so simple to use the
data segment to keep data..
<p>The data (as raw data) can be used at run-time by calling
the FindResource and LoadResource APIs.
<p>This type of resource is RCDATA (type number 10) when used with BEGIN and END, and not with
a filename.  Alternatively you can choose any name for the resource in which case it
works the same way as RCDATA except that the resource type has a name.
This is called a <i>user-defined resource</i>. Alternatively you can also
simply provide any 16-bit number above 0FFh for the resource type.
<p>The syntax for RCDATA used in this way is:-
<pre><i>nameID</i> RCDATA
[<i>defining-statements</i>]
BEGIN
	<i>raw-data</i>
END</pre>
<p>Or, in the case of a <i>user-defined resource</i>:-
<pre><i>nameID type</i>
[<i>defining-statements</i>]
BEGIN
	<i>raw-data</i>
END</pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>nameID</i>				can be either:-
						a 16-bit number of value 1 to 7FFFh
						an expression which evaluates to that number
						a name

<i>defining-statements</i>		need not be present, but can be either:-
						a VERSION statement
						a CHARACTERISTICS statement
						a LANGUAGE statement

						see <a href="#defs">below</a> for details

<i>type</i>					can be either:-
						a 16-bit number greater than 0FFh
						an expression which evaluates to a 16-bit number greater than 255
						a name in characters

<i>raw-data</i>				can be either:-
						an ANSI quoted string
						a Unicode quoted string starting with L"
						a numerical value stored as a word
						a numerical value stored as a dword (ending in L)</pre>
<pre><b><u>Examples</u></b>
0x3333 RCDATA
BEGIN
	"Hello world"
	"Hello world (zero terminated)\0"
	L"A Unicode version of the above\0"
	0x9999 &nbsp;<i>;hex number stored as a word</i>
END

MyRes RCDATA
BEGIN
	1034	<i>;decimal number stored as a word</i>
END

MyRes MyResType
BEGIN
	10456L	<i>;decimal number stored as a dword</i>
	1234L,56666L,99999L	<i>;decimal numbers stored as dwords</i>
END

END</pre>
<a name="ste"></a><h2>The STRINGTABLE Resource<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The STRINGTABLE resource enables strings to be kept in
the EXE to be recovered when needed at run time. For assembler programmers
this would be an alternative to keeping the strings in the data segment.
Even if you need to use Unicode strings, if you are using GoAsm as your 
assembler it is usually 
easier to keep the strings in data rather than to use the STRINGTABLE resource.
<p>If the source file is in ANSI format, strings in the STRINGTABLE resource 
are automatically converted to Unicode by the Resource Compiler, so there is 
no need to use the "C" style Unicode indicator L"<i>string</i>". The Resource 
Compiler regards the L"<i>string</i>" indicator as implicit.  The conversion
is carried out using the API MultiByteToWideChar. This API uses
the current codepage for this conversion, so you need to ensure that at
compile time your machine is set to use the same codepage as was used when
the source script was made.
<p>If the source file is in Unicode format, then no conversion takes place
and codepages are not used; the strings are used as they appear in the resource 
script.
<p>One reason why the assembler programmer might wish
to keep strings in a STRINGTABLE resource rather than in the data segment
would be to take advantage of the ability of the system to distinguish
strings of different languages at run-time.
<p>The strings are kept in blocks of 16 strings. Each block
will have the same language and also the same upper 12 bits of the ID which
was specified in the resource script. The least significant 4 bits are
blanked out and are not be recorded because it is assumed that the IDs
run in sequence in each block from 0 to 0Fh. To make this assumption valid,
if the string IDs are not in sequence the Resource Compiler has to insert
empty strings. To reduce space requirements, therefore, it is best to keep
the identifiers sequential.
<p>To recover one of the strings, call LoadString giving the
string identifier. It will then be copied into a buffer with a nul terminator.
<p>The syntax for the STRINGTABLE resource is as follows:-
<pre>STRINGTABLE
[<i>defining-statements</i>]
BEGIN
<i>stringID "string"</i>
<i>.........</i>
END</pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>stringID</i>	can be either:-
			a 16-bit number which identifies the string
			an expression which resolves to that number</pre>
<pre><i>"string"</i>	can be either:-
			a quoted string of not more than 4097 characters
			an expression which is defined elsewhere as a string</pre>
<p>If the string straddles more than one line the Resource Compiler inserts
a space and a line feed character (ASCII 0Ah) at the line break and all
leading spaces on the next line in your resource script are suppressed.
<h4>Information resource types</h4>
<p>These types of resources are used to keep information
about the EXE in a certain format, for use by tools or for information
to the user.
<p>There are two types of such resources.
<p>Firstly DLGINCLUDE (resource type17) which contains a
filename which is read by the Microsoft Dialog Editor. This filename is
that of the include file containing definitions when making dialogs. This
information is not actually kept in the EXE, and is disgarded by the linker.
<p>Its syntax is:-
<pre><i>nameID</i> DLGINCLUDE <i>filename</i></pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>nameID</i>	can be either:-
			a 16-bit number of value 1 to 7FFFh
			an expression which evaluates to that number
			a name</pre>
<pre><i>filename</i>	can be either:-
			a quoted string
			a non-quoted string
			a string in less-than and greater-than characters
			unless the file is in the current directory, the full
			path should be given</pre>
<a name="ver"></a><h2>The VERSIONINFO Resource<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>Secondly, the VERSIONINFO resource (resource type 16),
which is used to keep information about the version of the EXE and may
be required during its installation or if it is updated.
<p>The version information can be retrieved in various ways
using the APIs GetFileVersionInfo, GetFileVersionInfoSize, and VerQueryValue.
Also it is the information which appears in the "Version" property sheet
when looking at the "Properties" of an Executable file in Windows.
<p>The syntax for this resource is:-
<pre>1 VERSIONINFO

<p>Where,
<pre><i>fixed-info statements</i>	can be one or more of the following statements with data as in the following
					examples. The data is used by the Resource Compiler to fill a structure of
					13 dwords which is kept in the binary resource file and therefore in the EXE
					file (the VS_FIXEDFILEINFO structure)

<pre>FILEVERSION 3h,0Ah,0,3Dh
					this value needs to be written as four 16-bit values which
					are in fact recorded as two dwords: in this example the first dword
					(most significant) is 3000Ah and the second dword (least significant)
					is 3Dh, producing a version value of 3000A 0000003Dh.

PRODUCTVERSION 6666h,0000h,0000h,7777h
					defines a product version of 66660000 00007777h

FILEFLAGSMASK 3Fh	specifies which bits in the next parameter are valid

FILEFLAGS <i>fileflags</i>	which can be one or more of the following flags or values:-
<pre>VS_FF_DEBUG		(1= the file contains debugging information)
VS_FF_PATCHED		(4= the version information has been changed from the
					original shipping version)
VS_FF_PRERELEASE	(2= the file is a development version only and is not
					commercially available)
VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD	(8= the file was not built using standard release procedures)
VS_FF_SPECIALBUILD	(20h= the file was built using standard release procedures but
					is a variation of the standard file of the same version number)</pre>
FILEOS <i>fileos</i>			where <i>fileos</i> specifies the operating system for which the file
					was designed and can be one of the following values:-
<pre>VOS_UNKNOWN		(value zero - unknown)
VOS_DOS			(1000h= file designed for DOS)
VOS_NT				(4000h= file designed for Windows NT)
VOS__WINDOWS32	(4= file designed for 32-bit Windows)
VOS_NT_WINDOWS32	(40004h= file designed for 32-bit Windows running
					under Windows NT)</pre>
FILETYPE <i>filetype</i>		where <i>filetype</i> specifies the general type of
					the file and can be one of the following values:-
<pre>VFT_UNKNOWN		(value zero=unknown)
VFT_APP			(1= it’s an application)
VFT_DLL				(2= it’s a DLL)
VFT_DRV			(3= it’s a device driver)
VFT_FONT			(4= it’s a font)
VFT_VXD			(5= it’s a virtual device)
VFT_STATIC_LIB		(7= it’s a static link library)</pre>
FILESUBTYPE <i>subtype</i>		where <i>subtype </i>specifies more information about the type of file,
						and if <i>filetype</i> is VFT_DRV can be one of the following values:-
<pre>VFT2_UNKNOWN 		(value zero -unknown)
VFT2_PRINTER		(1= it’s a printer driver)
VFT2_KEYBOARD		(2= it’s a keyboard driver)
VFT2_LANGUAGE		(3= it’s a language driver)
VFT2_DISPLAY		(4= it’s a display driver)
VFT2_MOUSE		(5= it’s a mouse driver)
VFT2_NETWORK		(6= it’s a network driver)
VFT2_SYSTEM		(7= it’s a system driver)
VFT2_DRV_INSTALLABLE	(8= it’s an installable driver)
VFT2_DRV_SOUND	(9= it’s a sound driver)
VFT2_DRV_COMM		(0Ah= it’s a communications driver)

					if <i>filetype</i> is VFT_FONT it can be one of the following values:-

VFT2_FONT_RASTER		(1= a raster font)
VFT2_FONT_VECTOR		(2= a vector font)
VFT2_FONT_TRUETYPE	(3= a TrueType font)

					if <i>filetype</i> is VFT_VXD this value must be the virtual-device
					identifier included in the virtual-device control block
</pre></pre>
					The names of the <i>fixed-info statements </i>are fixed and are used by the
					Resource Compiler to decide where in the VS_FIXEDFILEINFO structure
					to put the specified value. As you can see, certain values have definite
					meanings reserved by Microsoft, but there seems to be no reason why
					you cannot use your own values which may have a special meaning to
					your application.

<i>lang-charset</i>			is a quoted string containing (in numbers) a hex number which gives
					the language and character set used in the string-value statements
					which follow. The most common value found here is "040904E4" meaning
					US English + Windows, multilingual character set.

					<i>lang/char statements</i> are two 16-bit numbers separated by a comma.
					The first represents a language and the second a character set supported
					by the application. If a lang/char statement is included in the VERSIONINFO
					resource, the system will initialise the "Version" property sheet found
					when looking at the "Properties" of the executable file, and will include
					a "Language" key. The most common value found is 0x409,1252 which is
					US English + Windows, multilingual character set, with the latter being
					given in its decimal value, but 4E4h would do just as well.
					
<i>string-value statements</i>	are a series of statements containing two quoted strings
					with the following syntax:-

					<i>"name", "value"</i>

		"<i>name"</i>		is a string which would be given to the
					API VerQueryValue in order to retrieve the <i>value</i>.
					
					The following strings are looked for by the system when showing
					the "Version" property sheet:-

					"FileVersion", "FileDescription" and "LegalCopyright",
					and the <i>value</i> appears at the top of the property sheet adjacent
					to the words "File Version", "Description" and "Copyright" respectively.

					Other strings appear in listboxes in the property sheet. You can use
					whatever string you like, although if they are too long they are truncated
					in the property sheet and they always appear in alphabetical order.

					You often see one of the following strings being used:-
					"Comments" "CompanyName" "InternalName"
					"LegalTradmarks" "OriginalFilename" "PrivateBuild"
					"ProductName" "ProductVersion" "SpecialBuild"

		"<i>value</i>"		is a user defined value in a quoted string which corresponds to
					one of the standard strings and will be returned by VerQueryValue.

<h2>Resources for the User-Interface</h2>
<p>These types of resources make it easy to create accelerators,
menus, and dialogs - three basic ingredients for the user interface. In
each case it is possible to use the APIs instead of using the resource
file, but this is normally much less convenient, and no advantage can be
taken of the system being able automatically to discriminate between menus
and dialogs of different languages.
<p>In order to use these resources, in a single language
application a specific API is called to obtain a handle to the resource.
<p>The five resource types under this heading, the resource
type numbers and the APIs used to use the resources are:-
<pre>ACCELERATORS	9	LoadAccelerators
MENU			4	LoadMenu
MENUEX			4	LoadMenu
DIALOG			5	CreateDialogParam, DialogBoxParam
DIALOGEX		5	CreateDialogParam, DialogBoxParam</pre>

<p>Where,
<pre><i>nameID</i>				can be either:-

						a name

<i>defining-statements</i>		need not be present, but can be either:-
						a VERSION statement
						a CHARACTERISTICS statement
						a LANGUAGE statement

						see <a href="#defs">below</a> for details

<i>event</i>				specifies the keystroke which will cause <i>result</i> to be sent to the
					message loop of the process which loaded the accelerators.
					It can be either:-
						a single character enclosed in quotes
							eg. "a" meaning the key "a"
						a single character preceded by a caret
							eg. "^A" meaning the key is a Crtl key
							if ^ is used the character must be an upper case letter
						a 16-bit number
						an expression which evaluates to a 16-bit number
							eg. the commonly used VK_ names listed in Winuser.h

<i>result</i>				can be either:-
						a 16-bit number
						an expression which evaluates to a 16-bit number

<i>type/options</i>			can be any of the following values, separated by commas:-
						ASCII		(value zero, meaning that the event value refers
									to an ASCII character value)
						VIRTKEY		(1= meaning that the event value refers
									to a virtual key value)
						(if neither ASCII nor VIRTKEY are specified, then ASCII is assumed)
						SHIFT		(4= event only occurs if Shft key is pressed)
						CONTROL	(8= event only occurs if Crtl key is pressed)
						ALT			(10h= event only occurs if Alt key is pressed)
						NOINVERT	(2= do not highlight a top level menu item if
									possible when an accelerator is used)</pre>

						a name

<i>defining-statements</i>		need not be present, but can be either:-
						a VERSION statement
						a CHARACTERISTICS statement
						a LANGUAGE statement

						see <a href="#defs">below</a> for details

<i>"text"</i>				is a quoted string containing the text for the menu or popup item,
					which can also contain:-
						\t	which inserts a tab
						\a	which aligns to the right all text which follows it
						&amp;	the system uses the following character as an accelerator key
						&amp;&amp;	use two ampersands to write &amp;
					You can have a menu item without any text by having "" in this field,
					but this simply gives the same result as having a SEPARATOR.
					If you want a completely empty menu line use " " instead, giving the
					menu item a string which contains only a space.

<i>id</i>					is the value which is sent to the window procedure of the window
					which owns the menu. It can be:-
						a 16-bit number (MENU) or a 32-bit number (MENUEX)
						an expression which evaluates to the above number

<i>type/state</i>				is one or more of the following words separated by spaces or
					the | (OR) operator:-

			<i>type</i>
					MENUBREAK			40h
							puts the next menu item on a new line or in a new column
							in the case of popup menus
					MENUBARBREAK		20h
							same as above but includes a separator line
					OWNERDRAW		100h
							process is responsible for drawing the menu
					RADIOCHECK		200h
							radio button used instead of check-mark for checked items
					RIGHTJUSTIFY		4000h
							right justifies menu text only, not popups
					HELP				4000h
							identifies a help item
					SEPARATOR			800h
							for popups only
			<i>state</i>
					CHECKED			8h
						checks the menu item
					GRAYED				3h
							disables and greys the menu item
					DISABLED			3h
							same as above
					INACTIVE			2h
							menu item not greyed but cannot be selected
					HILITE				80h
							highlights the menu item
					DEFAULT			1000h
							displays text in bold and the enter key will act in the same way
							as a mouse click on this item

					Instead of using the <i>type/state</i> words, you can use their respective value
					instead, but ensure that they are inserted as follows:-
						<i>type,state</i>
					or	<i>type+type,state+state</i>
					(type values are first, then comma, then state values)

<i>helpID</i>				(MENUEX only) is the value sent to the window procedure of the window
					which owns the menu if F1 is pressed when the menu is active. It can be:-
						a 32-bit number
						an expression which evaluates to a 32-bit number

					<b>important</b> - in the POPUP statement, to ensure that the <i>helpID</i> is
					properly identified, make sure there are a total of 3 commas between
					<i>id</i> and <i>helpID</i>. This tells the Resource Compiler that <i>helpID</i> is not
					a <i>type </i>nor a <i>style</i> value.

MENUITEM SEPARATOR	creates a horizontal line in the menu which is useful for

<i>iconcontrol</i>			displays an icon in the dialog box. The syntax for an <i>iconcontrol</i> is:-

					ICON <i>nameID, id, x, y</i>


					Where,

					<i>nameID</i>	is the identifier of an ICON resource and is either:-
								a 16-bit number of value 1 to 7FFFh
								an expression which evaluates to that number
								a quoted string containing the name of the ICON
									if the icon is identified by name

					<i>id</i>		can be either:-
								a 16-bit number (DIALOG) or a 32-bit number (DIALOGEX)
								an expression which evaluates to the above number

					<i>x</i>		is the horizontal position of the icon

					<i>y</i>		is the vertical position of the icon

<i>textcontrol</i>			is a dialog control which contains text and which has a name which is
					recognised by the Resource Compiler. The name of the type of control
					causes the Resource Compiler to give the control the correct class and a
					default style. To remove a default style you will need to use the NOT
					specifier, as you would to remove a default style for the dialog itself.
					The syntax for a <i>textcontrol</i> is:-

					<i>textcontrol "text", id, x, y, width, height, </i>[<i>,style</i>[<i>,extendedstyle</i>]]
					BEGIN
						<i>data-elements</i>
					END


					Where,

					<i>textcontrol</i>		is one of the names given below, listed here
									with their class and default style:-

					LTEXT			static class, SS_LEFT | WS_GROUP
									creates a static control with left aligned text
					CTEXT			static class, SS_CENTER | WS_GROUP
									creates a static control with centred text
					RTEXT			static class, SS_RIGHT | WS_GROUP
									creates a static control with right-aligned text
					GROUPBOX		button class, BS_GROUPBOX
									creates a labelled rectangle in the dialog box
									inside which other controls can be grouped
					CHECKBOX		button class, BS_CHECKBOX | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a check box control (small rectangle with text
									next to it)
					AUTOCHECKBOX	button class, BS_AUTOCHECKBOX | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a check box control which automatically
									changes to checked or unchecked when the user
									clicks in the control
					STATE3			button class, BS_3STATE | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a check box control which has 3 states
									checked, unchecked, and disabled (greyed)
					AUTO3STATE		button class, BS_AUTO3STATE | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a STATE3 control which automatically toggles
									when clicked between the 3 states
					RADIOBUTTON	button class, BS_RADIOBUTTON | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a radio button control
					AUTORADIOBUTTON		button class,
									BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON | WS_TABSTOP
									creates an automatic radio button
					PUSHBUTTON	button class, BS_PUSHBUTTON | WS_TABSTOP
									creates an ordinary push button control containing text
					DEFPUSHBUTTON	button class,
									BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON | WS_TABSTOP
									creates an ordinary push button control containing text
									and showing as the default if the user presses enter
					PUSHBOX		button class,
									BS_USERBUTTON | BS_CHECKBOX | WS_TABSTOP
									giving a flat appearance to the button

					<i>"text"</i>	is the text to appear in the control

					<i>id</i>		can be either:-
								a 16-bit number (DIALOG) or a 32-bit number (DIALOGEX)
								an expression which evaluates to the above number

					<i>x</i>		is the horizontal position of the control in dialog units

					<i>y</i>		is the vertical position of the control in dialog units

					<i>width</i>	is the width of the control in dialog units

					<i>height</i>	is the height of the control in dialog units

					<i>style</i>				see <a href="#sty">above</a> for details

					<i>extendedstyle</i>		see <a href="#xsty">above</a> for details

					<i>data-elements</i>		are one or more elements of data, called "creation data".
							A pointer to this data is sent to the dialog procedure in the
							lParam parameter of the WM_CREATE message when the
							control is created. The data is made using the same format
							as for the RCDATA resource.

<i>non-textcontrol</i>			is similar to a <i>textcontrol</i> except that it does not contain text	in the first
					instance (this must be added at run-time).
					The syntax for a <i>non-textcontrol</i> is:-

					<i>non-textcontrol id, x, y, width, height, </i>[<i>,style</i>[<i>,extendedstyle</i>]]
					BEGIN
						<i>data-elements</i>
					END


					Where the <i>id</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>style</i> and <i>extendstyle</i> parameters are the
					same as for the <i>text-control</i>.

					<i>non-textcontrol</i>		is one of the names given below,
									listed here with their class and default style:-

					EDITTEXT		edit class, ES_LEFT | WS_BORDER | WS_TABSTOP
									creates a simple edit control
					HEDIT			handwriting edit (pen) control
					IEDIT			ink edit (pen) control
					LISTBOX			listbox class, LBS_NOTIFY | WS_BORDER
									creates a basic listbox
					SCROLLBAR		scrollbar class, SBS_HORZ
									creates a basic scrollbar
					COMBOBOX		combobox class, CBS_SIMPLE
									creates a basic combobox control

<i>generic-control</i>			is a control where you explicitly specify the class of the control.
					It is mainly used for those control classes which do not come into the
					button, edit, static, listbox, scrollbar, or combobox classes. However,
					you can use the <i>generic-control</i> syntax to make those controls too.
					The syntax for a <i>generic-control</i> is as follows:-

					CONTROL <i>"text", id, class, style, x, y, width, height</i> [,<i>style,[extendedstyle</i>]]
					BEGIN
						<i>data-elements</i>
					END


					Where the <i>id</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>style</i> and <i>extendstyle</i> parameters are
					the same as for the <i>text-control</i>. Note that here there are no default styles,
					other than WS_CHILD and WS_VISIBLE, so <i>style</i> and <i>extendedstyle</i>
					should be chosen to suit the particular control being made. 


					<i>"text"</i>	can be either:-
								a quoted string containing the text for the control
									or "" if it has no text
								in the case of a STATIC class control which has the
									SS_BITMAP style, <i>"text"</i> can be a 16-bit number
									representing the bitmap concerned
								an expression which evaluates to the above text or number

							For the controls which do not normally take initial text,
							(see <i>non-textcontrols</i> above) you must include an empty
							<i>text</i> string by specifying "", for the <i>text</i> parameter.

					<i>class</i>	can be either:-
								a 16-bit number of value 80h to 85h
									(if one of the first six in the list below)
								an expression which evaluates to the above number
								a quoted string containing the name of the class shown
									in the second column of the list below
								a word shown in the first column of the list below
								a quoted string (for a user-defined class)

							The class can therefore be one of the following:-

					BUTTON					"Button"			80h
					EDIT					"Edit"			81h
					STATIC					"Static"			82h
					LISTBOX					"Listbox"			83h
					SCROLLBAR				"Scrollbar"		84h
					COMBOBOX				"ComboBox"		85h
					WC_HEADER				"SysHeader32"
					WC_LISTVIEW			"SysListView32"
					WC_TREEVIEW			"SysTreeView32"
					HOTKEY_CLASS			"msctls_hotkey32"
					UPDOWN_CLASS			"msctls_updown32"
					ANIMATE_CLASS			"SysAnimate32"
					WC_COMBOBOXEX		"ComboBoxEx32"
					WC_TABCONTROL		"SysTabControl32"
					MONTHCAL_CLASS		"SysMonthCal32"
					PROGRESS_CLASS		"msctls_progress32"

<a name="defs"></a><h2>Defining Statements</h2>
<p>Defining statements give some further definition to each resource. There are three types of defining-statement:-
<ul>
<li>VERSION statement</li>
<li>CHARACTERISTICS statement</li>
<li>LANGUAGE statement</li>
</ul>
<p>Each defining statement is specific to the resource to which it refers,
however if LANGUAGE is specified outside a specific resource it will apply
to all resources thereafter.
<br>
<br>
<a name="verc"></a><h2>VERSION and CHARACTERISTICS<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The syntax for these is the same:-
<pre>VERSION <i>value</i>
CHARACTERISTICS <i>value</i></pre>
<p>Where,
<pre><i>value</i>		can be either:-
				a 32-bit number
				an expression which evaluates to a 32-bit number</pre>
<p>The <i>value</i> is stored only in the RES file and not in
the OBJ file nor in the EXE, so it cannot be recovered at run-time. However
it could be read by tools which work with the RES file, such as some linkers.
<a name="lang"></a><h2>LANGUAGE<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>The syntax of the LANGUAGE statement is:-
<pre>LANGUAGE <i>language, sublanguage</i></pre>
<p>This statement can appear anywhere in the script (outside
a BEGIN...END section). In that case the specified language applies to
all resources thereafter. It can also appear between the resource statement itself
and the BEGIN...END section as a <i>defining-statement</i>. In that case
the specified language only applies to the resource in which it appears.
<p>The actual values for <i>language</i> and <i>sublanguage</i> appear in
WINNT.H. The most common values for <i>language </i>are LANG_ENGLISH
(value 9h), and for <i>sublanguage </i>are SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US (value 1h),
SUBLANG_ENGLISH_UK (value 2h), SUBLANG_ENGLISH_AUS (value 3h) and SUBLANG_ENGLISH_CAN
(value 4h). If no language is specified in your resource script the
Resource Compiler uses the system language and inserts that in the binary
resource file.
<h3>Making different language versions of a resource</h3>
<p>If your product is to be used in more than one language,
you will need to provide different menu and dialog text, warning and error
messages to suit the language. The combined features of the Resource Compiler
and the API make it reasonably easy to achieve this. The exact way this
is achieved, in the context of resources, depends on whether you want:-
<ul>
<li>different EXE or DLL files for each language version, or</li>
<li>several languages available from the same EXE</li>
</ul>
<p>The first can be achieved by having different resource scripts,
or by use of the conditional directives, which would instruct the Resource
Compiler to compile only those parts of the resource script relevant to
the desired language (see <i>conditional directives</i> above).
<p>The second is possible because the API FindResource will
automatically return the handle of the resource which suits the default
system language for the computer which is running the program. FindResource
does this by obtaining the default system language and then calling FindResourceEx.
If you want to specify the language of the resource to be found, rather
than relying on the system default language, then you can call FindResourceEx
directly giving the language ID.
<p>FindResource can be used as follows:-
<pre>PUSH <i>resource type</i>		;by type number or by name if a user-defined resource
PUSH <i>resource nameID</i>		;use only a name identifier not a number
PUSH <i>hModule </i>			;this is hInst or zero to use current process
CALL FindResource</pre>
<p>FindResourceEx can be used as follows
<pre>PUSH <i>resource language</i>	;see below
PUSH <i>resource nameID</i>		;use only a name identifier not a number
PUSH <i>resource type</i>		;by type number or by name if a user-defined resource
PUSH <i>hModule</i>			;this is hInst or zero to use current process
CALL FindResourceEx</pre>
<p>Note that the nameID and type parameters are reversed for FindResourceEx!
<br>The <i>resource language</i> is a 32-bit value made up
as follows:-
<br>Least significant 10 bits - the primary language value:
<br>Next 6 bits - the secondary language value
<br>Most significant 16 bits - zero
<br>For a list of the language values see WINNT.h
<p>The return from FindResource and FindResourceEx is the
handle which is needed for the call to LoadResource. You can have several
versions of a menu or dialog, for example, with the same <i>nameID</i>
but with different languages specified. FindResource will return the handle
of the correct one.
<h3>Language specific menus</h3>
<p>Since the FindResource (or FindResourceEx) and LoadResource
combination provide an address to the resource data itself, in order to
load a language specific menu, you need to pass that address as the menu
template to LoadMenuIndirect. You cannot use LoadMenu to load a language
specific menu.
<h3>Language specific dialogs</h3>
<p>Similarly, to make a language specific dialog box you
need to pass the address of the dialog template returned by LoadResource
to DialogBoxIndirect (modal) or CreateDialogIndirect (non-modal) rather
than using the CreateDialog and DialogBox APIs. Other language specific
components which are needed in your dialog should either be given a unique
<i>nameID</i> or loaded at run-time. For example, if you have a French
version of your dialog and want to include a French menu by using the MENU
<i>defining-statement</i> in the resource script, a <i>nameID</i> must
be given in the MENU statement which uniquely refers to the French menu.
Alternatively if you have several language versions of the menu all with
the same <i>nameID</i> you could load the menu at run-time upon the INIT_DIALOG
message. This would be done by calling FindResource or FindResourceEx,
then LoadResource (to get and address for the menu template of the correct
menu), LoadMenuIndirect (to get the menu handle) and then SetMenu (to load
the menu into the dialog box).
<h3>Language specific strings and raw data</h3>
<p>When loading language specific strings, you can use LoadString
directly. This loads a string to suit the system default language. Alternatively
the address of the string itself can be obtained using FindResource, or
FindResourceEx and LoadResource. The same method works for RCDATA and for a
user-defined resource (and indeed for any resource which can be used by
obtaining an address of the raw data of the resource).
<h3>Examples for viewing</h3>
<p>Testbug.Exe provides examples of loading language specific
menus, dialogs, strings and raw data. The relevant functions to look at
with the debugger are:-
<p>Menus, dialogs and raw data example, click "use of resources/different
language versions/various resources in English" or "same showing French
versions" in the menu, watching with the debugger the functions RESOURCES_IN_ENGLISH
and RESOURCES_IN_FRENCH, which create dialog boxes using the dlg wndproc
called MDLangDlgProc.
<p>Strings, click "Language specific string" in the menu,
watching with the debugger the function STRINGTABLES_BY_LANGUAGE.
<h3>Language search criteria</h3>
<p>When searching for language specific resources, the system
looks for a language match but has certain defaults if an exact match is
not found. The system carries out the search for a resource of the correct
type and ID in this order, moving down the list if the resource is not
yet found:-
<ul><li>Match both of primary language and sublanguage</li>
<li>Match on primary language only</li>
<li>A primary language of LANG_NEUTRAL (value zero)</li>
<li>A primary language of English</li>
<li>Any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly if the exact specified language is not present in
the EXE, FindResourceEx will provide some output provided the resource
type and ID match. So there is no need to worry that your product will
not work in the Land of the Wizard if you use language specific resources.
<h3>Own language values</h3>
<p>You can specify your own language values if you wish,
and by this method it would be possible to make several versions of menus,
dialogs and strings for your product in the <i>same</i> language if you
wished, using the automatic language selection referred to above. To keep
the system happy, ensure that your <i>language</i> value is between 200h
and 3FFh, and the <i>sublanguage</i> value is between 20h and 3Fh. These
values are carefully chosen. The actual languageID inserted in the binary
resource file and kept in the EXE is only 16 bits long, the <i>language</i>
value occupying the most significant 10 bits (hence a maximum value of
3FFh) and the <i>sublanguage</i> value occupying the least significant
6 bits (hence a maximum value of 3Fh).

<a name="cap"></a><h2>Capitalisation of nameIDs and types<a href="#top"><img SRC="up.gif" BORDER=0 height=12 width=24>top</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that a resource nameID can either be a string of 
characters or a number.  For each type of resource with a 
particular language the nameID must be unique.  Ie. two dialogs can have
the same nameID provided they have different language values.
We have also seen that a user-defined resource will have a resource
type identified by a string of characters or a number.
<p>Now, the Resource Compiler will always convert the nameID or type
to <i>upper case</i> when inserting them in the RES file or OBJ file.
The reason for this is that this is expected by Windows.  In practice
this does not affect the way you use the resource because the system will
also capitalise any nameIDs or types given to the resource APIs.
For example suppose you have a dialog with a nameID of "MyDlg".  Then
to use the dialog you would pass the string "MyDlg" to the API
CreateDialog.  But in fact, the system converts the string to MYDLG
and then looks for that string (as converted) in the executable.
<p>This has two implications which you may need to be aware of.
<p>Firstly it means that there would be a conflict in the above example
if you had a second dialog (with the same language value) called MYDLG.
This would be picked up at link-time by the linker.</li>
<p>Secondly, the Resource Compiler must ensure that not only English 
nameIDs or user-defined types are converted properly to upper case.
So the Resource Compiler relies on the API CharUpper to do this conversion.
This API can handle a number of languages properly, but it does rely
on language mapping.  Ensure that the machine used for compiling does
support the language used in the nameIDs and user-defined types.
Many languages do not actually have an upper case at all, in which case
no conversion will take place.
